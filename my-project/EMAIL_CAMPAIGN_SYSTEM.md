```bash
mysql -u your_user -p your_database < database/schema.sql
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Create Email Campaign
1. Navigate to `/campaigns/email-builder`
2. Fill in campaign details (title, subject, sender info)
3. Design email using Unlayer editor
4. Save design and campaign

### 2. Send Campaign

2. Select the created campaign
3. Choose recipients (filter by group if needed)
4. Click "Send" to queue emails

### 3. Monitor Progress
1. Navigate to `/campaigns/monitor`
2. View queue statistics and success rates
3. Monitor recent email activity
4. Manually trigger queue processing if needed

## Configuration

### Queue Settings
Modify `app/lib/emailQueue.ts` to adjust:
- `batchSize`: Number of emails per batch (default: 10)
- `batchDelay`: Delay between batches in ms (default: 2000)
- `retryDelay`: Delay before retrying failed emails (default: 5000)
- `maxAttempts`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)

### SMTP Settings
Update `app/lib/email.ts` to configure:
- SMTP host, port, and security settings

- Connection verification

## Security Features

- **Role-based Access**: Only admin users can access campaign management
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error tracking without exposing sensitive data
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays prevent SMTP server overload

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Queue Health
- Monitor queue statistics regularly
- Check for stuck emails in "sending" status
- Review failed email logs for patterns

### SMTP Health
- Test SMTP connection regularly
- Monitor delivery rates
- Check for authentication issues

### Database Maintenance
- Regularly clean old logs (older than 90 days)
- Monitor queue table size
- Archive completed campaigns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **SMTP Connection Failed**
   - Verify SMTP credentials
   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure correct port configuration

2. **Emails Stuck in Queue**
   - Check SMTP server status
